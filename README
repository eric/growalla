growalla.rb
Growl notifications for Gowalla checkins.

Specifically: sets up a local web app using Sinatra, tunnels it out through
ReverseHTTP using Hookout, subscribes to PubSubHubbub notifications for your
Gowalla friends Atom feed, and shells out to growlnotify for each notifcation.

INSTALLATION:
 1. Install Growl and growlnotify (from the Extras folder):
    http://growl.info/
 2. Install prerequisite gems:
    $ gem sources -a http://gems.github.com
    $ sudo gem install sinatra thin paulj-hookout
 3. Install growalla:
    $ curl http://github.com/sco/growalla/raw/master/growalla.rb > growalla.rb

USAGE:
  $ ruby growalla.rb sco    [with your Gowalla username, not mine]

   Within a minute or so, you should get a Growl message saying notifications
   are on. After that, new checkins from friends should appear within 30 seconds
   of happening.


TODO:
- checkin comments
- spot or user images
- hub auto-discovery
- notify each of the summaries, not just the last
- check that growlnotify exists

growalla_pull_you.rb
Growl notifications without the hubbub

I tried using the PubSubHubbub version for a while but never seemed to get
any updates. In hopes to get something working, I changed to a polling-based
client.

I also added displaying of avatars... because it just doesn't look good
without them.

You can see an example of it as:
  http://skitch.com/lindvall/ndcxt/growalla-avatar-example

USAGE:
  $ ruby growalla_pull_you.rb lindvall  [again, your Gowalla username]

  You'll then see any new notifications as they float in.
